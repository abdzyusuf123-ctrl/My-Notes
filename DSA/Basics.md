Basics of Coding Intervies
This file contains all the useful tricks/fundamentals of solving coding interviews

For Loops
We typically use a for loop for when we are going over an array

Here are a the 3 main variations:
nums = [1,2,3,4,5]
1) for n in nums: - This is when we need to read the data in the array for some computation and NOT than changing the array
2) for i in range(len(nums)): - This is when we want to change the data in the array and NOT just read the data
3) for i, n in enumerate(nums): - This is when you want to change the data in the array BUT you can automatically get the data as well
Note: If the problem provides you an input array 


While Loops
We typically use a While Loop for when a condition is true
